> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>La Maison du Camembert
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - The creation of camembert cheese is attributed to Marie Harel in 1791.  It grew in popularity over time, helped along by the approval of Napoleon III and its distribution to French soldiers during World War I.  Today it is one of the most popular cheeses in France, and is consumed around the world.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Cheesemaking*—As with [cheddar](#mmbio-writeupcheddar-gorge-cheese-company), camembert begins as raw milk that is coagulated using rennet.  Unlike cheddar however, the curds that develop are not pressed, but are rather allowed to settle and drain off whey naturally.  Additionally, instead of being wrapped, camembert is left open to the air to allow its outer rind to develop.  The white rind of camembert is primarily made up of the fungus Penicillium camemberti, also known as Penecillium candidum.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - Camembert is still widely produced today, and if produced under the AOC designation (see below), is subject to very specific requirements.
>
> **~~Coolest~~ Saddest Part**
> - *True* camembert (also known as AOC camembert—AOC standing for *appellation d’origine contrôlée*, or controlled designation of origin) is illegal in the United States, because it is unpasteurized.

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Le Cordon Bleu
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - Breadmaking predates recorded history.  Le Cordon Bleu was first established in 1895.  Today it has over 30 locations worldwide.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Formation of gluten*—When water is added to flour, it allows two classes of protein, glutenin and gliadin to combine with each other and form gluten.  Kneading dough helps move that process along, developing an elastic gluten network within the dough.
> - *Fermentation*—Yeast ferments sugars in the dough into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  The elasticity of the gluten helps keeps the carbon dioxide from escaping, causing the dough to rise.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - Bread has been around for a long time, but it's also not going anywhere anytime soon.  It remains a staple food throughout the world.  Understanding the science of breadmaking is important to developing different types of bread and creating variations in flavor and consistency.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - I finally understand what gluten actually is.  It's more than just a buzzword to me now.

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Jardin des Plantes Grande Galerie de l'Évolution
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - The Grande Galerie de l'Évolution features animals from all over the world, with a special emphasis on how individual species developed.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Speciation and natural selection*—As separate groups of the same species diverge in traits, new species develop.  As traits develop among individuals within a group, natural selection may cause that species to evolve into a new one over time.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - For me, one of the biggest takeaways from understanding natural selection is the importance of avoiding *unnatural* selection.  Intentional selective breeding can be very valuable (see below), but other things such as hunting and urban development can cause unintentional effects that lead to the extinction of species.  It's important that we do our part to maintain the incredible biodiversity of the world.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - I enjoyed seeing the differences in the types of wool from different breeds of sheep.  Selective breeding is strong contributing factor in these differences.

*Our guide, the head grower, is at the back right to the left of Dr. Johnson*

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>La Caverne
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - La Caverne is part of a city cleanup project.  It resides in an abandoned underground parking structure that for some time was a hot spot for drug dealing and prostitution.  Nowadays, the parking structure is free of crime, and is used by La Caverne for mushroom and endive farming, as well as by other companies that they rent space out to.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Fungiculture*—a variety of mushrooms are farmed at La Caverne.  Mushrooms are more touchy than most plants when it comes to farming, so the controlled environment of the underground parking structure is very conducive to their farming.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - La Caverne is a great model for urban development.  As more places like La Caverne are created, they will have positive effects on the social, environmental, and economic aspects of their surrounding communities.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - In one of the large farming rooms, we were told that when at full growing capacity, it is only safe to remain in the room for up to 20 minutes at a time, because of the spores in the air.

The Plague of Ashdod *by Nicholas Poussin*

<img src="./2022-7-21/the_plague_of_ashdod_description.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>The Louvre
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - The plague described in 1 Samuel is perhaps the earliest known documentation of the bubonic plague.  In addition to the biblical account, Poussin's depiction is also influenced by the contemporary events of the ongoing plague in Italy during which he painted the piece.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Bacteria*—today, bubonic plague is attributed to the bacteria Yersinia pestis, which multiplies in the body and causes the lymph nodes to swell.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - The plague continues to be endemic in some countries and present on five continents (oddly enough, Australia, a land known for its natural dangers, is not among them).
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - See the historical significance above!

*Lunch time*

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - Cheddar cheese originates from Cheddar, England.  Today, cheddar cheese is one of the most popular varieties of cheeses and is made all over the world.  Today, Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company is the sole producer of cheddar cheese in Cheddar, England.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Chemical reactions*—cheesemaking involves a lot of chemical reactions, the most important being the one that causes the coagulation of milk into curds.  For cheddar and many other varieties of cheeses, this coagulation is achieved by adding rennet, a set of enzymes.
> - *Bacteria*—many cheeses, including cheddar, are aged in order to develop flavor.  In cheddar, this flavor comes from lactic acid bacteria and the lactic acid that they produce.  Other cheeses similarly contain lactic acid bacteria, as well as different types of mold.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - Microbiology continues to be an important aspect of cheesemaking to this day, and perhaps increasingly so as we come to better understand the actual processes that are taking place in the production of cheese.  Hopefully, as new discoveries are made in microbiology, there will also be new developments in cheesemaking.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - Definitely all the taste testing that we got to do after our tour.

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Roman Baths
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - The temple surrounding the Roman Baths was constructed in the first century A.D.  They were functional for about five centuries, after which they fell into ruin, until later redevelopment in the Middle Ages.  Today they are not open for bathing, but are maintained as a historical site.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Ecology*—the water of the Roman Baths is a very unique environment.  It is a warm and chock-full of minerals.  While water from the spring is clean enough to drink, things will certainly begin to grow if it sits for a while.  The water is a good environment in particular for archaea—single-celled prokaryotes, often with unique cell walls for protection in harsh environments.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - There are so many varieties of microorganisms throughout the world, and new ones are constantly being identified.  Places like the Roman Baths are just one of many that have caught the interest of microbiologists for study.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - Just as we often throw coins into fountains, Romans would through tributes to Athena into the waters of Bath.  A wide variety of items have been found in the waters, including written requests for curses upon wrong-doers.

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Edward Jenner's House
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - Edward Jenner performed much of his research on and development of vaccination in and around his home.  In the Temple of Vaccinia, a small hut outside his home, he gave some of the first vaccinations.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Vaccination*—vaccination involves innoculating patients with a milder variation of a pathogen in order to allow the body to build up immunity.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - Vaccination continues to be extremely important to public health.  The development of new vaccines has been of particular importance to recent outbreaks such as those of COVID-19 and monkeypox, as well as in addressing the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - Although Jenner came up with the idea of vaccination using cowpox, a less dangerous relative of smallpox, the practice of variolation had been present in certain societies dating all the way back to 1000 B.C.  Variolation involved innoculating people with a small dose of smallpox, but was more risky than vaccination.  See the image comparing variolation and vaccination above.

>
> **Historical Significance**
> - Hook Norton is one of the few surviving tower breweries in the world.  They have been brewing beer commercially since 1856.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Fermentation*—yeast converts sugars (such as maltose) in wort into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - Fermentation is used today in many different products.  In addition to being used in the production of beer and other types of alcohol, fermentation is also used in the production of [other foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods) such as bread, yogurt, and chocolate.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - Amylase in the base malt breaks down malt starches into less complex sugars, just as enzymes in saliva would.  Rather than allowing these sugars to be used to feed the growth of the grains, these sugars are used as food for the yeast.


## Oxford

### Thursday, July 14

We left Cambridge today for Oxford.  On the bus, I fulfilled my agreement with MacKayla and we watched [*Hidden Figures*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures).  It was really cool to see how much the women in that movie accomplished.  I think the difficult positions they were in made it so they really couldn't afford not to put in all the incredible hard work that they did.  That hard work ended up putting them way ahead of many of the other women they worked with, especially when it came to adapting to use computers in their work.

The first place we visited in Oxford was the Museum of Natural History.  One thing that's crazy about that museum is that you can actually touch some of the animals on display.  It's a little sad of course, but I certainly wasn't going to turn down the chance I had to finally pet a bear.

<img src="./2022-7-14/bear_hug.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*A bear hug!*

They also had a lot of insects on display, including what I consider to be a perfect reflection of the Victorian Era in a number of ways.

<img src="./2022-7-14/flea.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*The Victorians were interesting*

From there we went to the History of Science Museum, which could probably be more properly labeled as the "Astrolabes and a Few Other Things Museum."

<img src="./2022-7-14/astrolabes.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*I'm still not really sure how these things work*

Part of why we visited that museum was for the penicillin display found in the basement, which was super interesting.  Penicillin has a long but recent history, and its original discovery is particualrly interesting.  Alexander Fleming had been culturing a bacteria in his lab, but it ended up becoming contaminated by a fungus.  He observed that the fungus (penicillium) seemed to be inhibiting and killing the bacteria around it.  Upon further research, he found that it was producing an antibacterial substance that he dubbed penicillin.  Other scientists developed methods to isolate and mass produce penicillin, which allowed it to be used to treat serious infections.

<img src="./2022-7-14/penicillin_model.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Model of the effect of Penicillium rubens on Staphylococcus aureus*

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Museum of Natural History & History of Science Museum
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - Penicillin played a significant role in the advancement of medicine and allowed many diseases and conditions that had been previously untreatable to be cured.
>
> **Scientific Principles**
> - *Natural selection*—the Museum of Natural History had some great displays on natural selection, but the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a great example of this as well.  Penicillin and other antibiotics have acted as natural selectors, killing off certain bacteria, while allowing antibiotic-resistant variations and mutations of those bacteria to survive.
>
> **Today's Application**
> - Antibiotics are still in use today to treat bacterial infections.  As antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become more prevalent, the need for alternative methods of treatment, such as vaccination, has become more pressing.
>
> **Coolest Part**
> - Also the grossest part—before the mass production of penicillin was achieved, penicillin was so scarce that the excess that passed through the systems of patients had to be reclaimed from their urine for isolation and reuse.


## Cambridge

### Wednesday, July 13

This morning we stopped by the Cavendish Laboratory, where the structure of DNA and about a million other things were discovered.  We didn't get to go in, because the labs are actually used for psychology and sociology studies these days (to my professors' dismay), but the buildings were very nice.

If you though the 12 Nobel Prize winners coming out of the LMB yesterday was impressive, just wait until you hear about Cavendish.  It has produced a total of [30 laureates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_Laboratory#Nobel_Laureates_at_the_Cavendish), with the first being in 1904 and the most recent in 2019.

<img src="./2022-7-13/cavendish_josephson_plaque.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*...and of something else that I hardly understand*

Being microbiology majors (apart from Josh and I), we were at Cavendish Labs primarily because of its role in Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA's double helix structure.  Just down the street is The Eagle, the pub where they announced their discovery.

<img src="./2022-7-13/the_eagle.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*The Eagle pub*

<img src="./2022-7-13/the_eagle_plaque.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Another plaque, commemorating Crick and Watson (and Franklin)*

It seemed obligatory to get a drink at this historic site, so I purchased myself an alcohol free beer.  It was terrible.

<img src="./2022-7-13/drink.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Taking a drink in commemoration of the work of Watson and Crick*

After our visit to the pub, and with my non-alcoholic drink still in hand and unfinished, we went to punt the Cam.  Punting looks similar to taking a gondola ride, but instead of using an oar, the punter just uses a big stick to push the punt along the river.

<img src="./2022-7-13/punting_group.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

<img src="./2022-7-13/sigh.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Punting the Cam with MacKayla and Sam! (rhyme intended)*

In the background of the previous photo you'll see other people punting, as well as the Bridge of Sighs.  This bridge is not to be confused with the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, Italy, nor with the Bridge of Sighs in Oxford, England.  It is also not to be confused with *Bridge of Spies*, featuring Tom Hanks.  In addition to its confusing name, Cambridge's Bridge of Sighs is also known for being the place where engineering students [suspended a car over the river](https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/how-cambridge-university-pranksters-managed-17836295) as a prank.

Before the boat trip was over I finally managed to gag down the last few drops of my beer.

Afterwards, we wandered through the town a bit, stopping at different shops as we went.  Eventually I ended up at the Fitzwilliam Museum, which had some really interesting art pieces.  One part of the museum was a special exhibit on [David Hockney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hockney).  I really liked the display of his digital art, mostly for the great description it had:

> "When Hockney discovered the iPhone, and subsequently the iPad, as drawing tools he was excited by their potential. 'This is a real new medium', he explained, 'So much variety is possible. You can't overwork this because it's not a real surface.  And you can put anything on anything: a bright, bright blue on top of an intense yellow.' . . . As he said, 'I draw flowers every day and send them to friends, so they get fresh flowers every morning. And my flowers last!'"

Another really interesting display involved a work by Nicholas Poussin.  Poussin was known for setting up 3D models to base his paintings off of in order to better account for lighting and depth.  Although it's not known for sure whether he used a model for the painting below, it is considered likely, and a model similar to what he may have used was constructed for the museum display.

Before the museum closed, we stopped by the gift shop, where I found some great socks featuring Ada Lovelace.  I'm not really sure how she relates to anything on display in the Fitzwilliam Museum, but she is widely considered to be the first computer programmer, so I had to buy them.

*"That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show." – Ada Lovelace<br>(This has proven to be true historically for Ada, and I believe it is a spiritual truth applicable to each of us.)*

After the museum, I got a tiny scoop of gelato.  I know failing to mention it would disappoint my sister.

After dessert, we picked up some real food at the grocery store and had a picnic in one of the parks.  When we were done eating, we played cards and MacKayla taught us some self-defense moves.

### Tuesday, July 12

Today we took a charter bus to Cambridge.  The bus ride was nice, and I got MacKayla to watch *The Imitation Game* with me during the trip, on the condition that I will watch *Hidden Figures* with her.  I think all the time we spent at the Science Museum on [Friday](#friday-july-8) might have had some influence on that agreement.

All of the guys in our group are staying at Westminster College, and **wow** the rooms are nice.  We each get a room to ourselves, complete with connected bathrooms and kitchen areas.  This is especially wonderful compared to having 9 to a room and sharing the bathrooms with the girls, as was the case in London.

<img src="./2022-7-12/westminster_college.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

After dropping our things off in our rooms, we all headed over to the Whipple Museum of the History of Science.  The museum wasn't very large, but they did have a huge range of items—primarily tools that would have been used for scientific study or teaching.

<img src="./2022-7-12/glass_fungi.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

*"Darwin's main research instrument from its purchased in 1847 to his death in 1882"*

After the Whipple Museum, we took a bus over to the Addenbrook's Hospital, where a BYU alum named John showed us around.  John is doing research on brain tumors, so we got to see the lab where he does most of his work, and then he also took us over to see the Laboratory of Molecular Biology.  The LMB has been home to the work of 12 different Nobel Prize laureates.

*Ampersand statue outside the LMB.  Not really sure what it's supposed to mean, but the colors remind me of a DNA sequence*

Right across from the LMB is the AstraZeneca building.  We didn't get to go inside, but it was still cool to see the headquarters of a company that came into the world spotlight so fairly.

<img src="./2022-7-12/astrazeneca.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*AstraZeneca building*

Before heading back to our rooms for the evening, we walked by Newton's Apple Tree, or more accurately, Son of Newton's Apple Tree, since it was grafted from the apple tree that stood outside Sir Isaac Newton's home.

<img src="./2022-7-12/son_of_newtons_apple_tree.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Son of Newton's Apple Tree*

Most places closed around 5 (other than the pubs of course, where I imagine things were just getting started), so even by the time we made it back to Westminster I still had a few hours to spare.  Just getting to relax in my room by myself for a few hours was probably one of my favorite parts of this trip so far.  I took a shower, worked on catching up on some travel entries, and called my sister over FaceTime.  It's unfortunate that we're only staying in Cambridge for two nights, but if we're lucky maybe we'll get to have rooms like this again.

## London

### Monday, July 11

We started off today by going to the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace.  It was a bit disappointing, not because of anything wrong with the way it was carried out, but simply because there were so many people it was impossible to see much.  I remember seeing the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington, D.C. a few years ago, so I was hoping for an experience something like that.  I think I felt like the one at Buckingham was more for show, whereas the one in D.C. felt more purely out of respect for who they were guarding.  I'm sure each have some elements of both show and respect though.

<img src="./2022-7-11/marching.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Procession for the changing of the guard*

<img src="./2022-7-11/gate_view.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*This was about the best I could see as far as what was actually happening within the gates of Buckingham Palace goes*

After the changing of the guard we went to the Imperial War Museum.  I'm not exactly sure what they mean by "Imperial" in the name, but the museum covered multiple wars, including World War I and II.

<img src="./2022-7-11/iwm.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

<img src="./2022-7-11/zero.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

I spent most of my time in their exhibit on the Holocaust.  I thought the exhibit was laid out really well.  It started off with some historical background and introduced a ton of individuals who would have been affected by the Holocaust.  The exhibit really helped me get to know those people by teaching me about their lives, their families, and their interests.  It helped me feel close to them and really comprehend that the victims of the Holocaust  were real people with lives just like my own and those of my friends and family.

<img src="./2022-7-11/siblings_with_cat.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*"Siblings Ruth and Klaus Boronow with their cat Roswitha at home in Breslau, Germany."*

The exhibit also of course taught about Hitler and his followers.  I think one of the most sickening parts of it all is recognizing that the Nazis were people as well and that they too had lives and families and interests.  It's easy to just blame everything on Hitler, but when you start to recognize how many other individuals were complicit in everything that happened, it's terrifying.  It's terrifying that one person could do such awful things, and it's even more terrifying that a whole bunch of people—many who would otherwise seem just like you and I—could do those things.

<img src="./2022-7-11/menorah.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*"In this photograph, a hanukkiah holding candles for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah sits in the home of Rabbi Dr Akiva Posner and his wife Rachel.  On the back of the image Rachel Wrote, 'Hanukkah 5692 (1932). The flag says, "Death to Judah".  The light answers, "Judah will live forever".'"*

Another difficult part was learning about how many children had to be separated from their families in order to find safety.  The part of the exhibit on that included many of the possessions of those children, along with their stories.  I admire the bravery and love of both the parents and children who had to go through that and the countless other challenges of that time.  And I'm grateful for my own family and the great love I know they have for me.

*"Steffi Leyser's father gave her this wallet for her travel documents.  He had received it as a boy as a gift for his bar mitzvah.  Steffi's favorite uncle gave her this puppet, which was one of the few items she was allowed to choose and pack for herself."*

Seeing the Holocaust exhibit was really powerful.  Lots of museums do a great job of showing off planes and tanks and guns, but they often are limited in how they acknowledge the costs that lie behind those things.  The Holocaust exhibit was a reminder of the cost of war, as well as a reminder of why we must choose to fight at times.

After our visit to the Imperial War Museum I split off with Dallin and MacKayla to go to Westminster Abbey.

<img src="./2022-7-11/westminster_abbey.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Westminster Abbey*

<img src="./2022-7-11/westminster_selfie.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Me, Dallin, and MacKayla outside Westminster Abbey*

The inside of the Abbey was beautiful.  Below is the view of where we came in once they had started clearing people out and getting ready for evensong.

<img src="./2022-7-11/window.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Inside the Abbey*

A ton of important people are buried at Westminster Abbey, including scientists, royalty, and writers.  It also turns out they have a grave of an unkown soldier of their own, just like the one in D.C. that I was talking about.  It's the only grave that you aren't allowed to walk on in the Abbey.

<img src="./2022-7-11/unknown_warrior.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Grave of the Unknown Warrior*

Among the graves of scientists were Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Michael Farraday, James Watt, and most recently, Stephen Hawking.

<img src="./2022-7-11/hawking.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Stephen Hawking's grave*

Nearby is what I thought was a grave, but it turned out to be just a memorial.  A lot of the memorials were on the walls rather than the floor, so I imagine it's significant that this one was allowed to take up precious floor space where someone else could have otherwise been buried.

<img src="./2022-7-11/mandela.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Memorial to Nelson Mandela*

There's a lot of royalty buried in Westminster Abbey as well.  Even with my extensive knowledge gained from my 10 days in London, I still have trouble keeping track of all the different Henrys and Elizabeths.  There were a few graves that distinctly stood out however.  The first were those of Mary (Queen of Scots) and Elizabeth (I), two cousins who had a fierce political rivalry stoked by religious differences.  In 1587, [Mary was executed](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/elizabeth-i-mary-queen-scots) as punishment for conspiracy to kill Elizabeth.  Years later, Mary's son had her body exhumed and placed alongside Elizabeth's in Westminster Abbey.  I really like the inscription that was placed at the heads of their tombs.

<img src="./2022-7-11/mary_and_elizabeth.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*The inscription explains part of why Mary and Elizabeth were placed side-by-side, despite their rivalry*

Just across from Mary and Elizabeth are the bones that were found hidden in the walls at the Tower of London (see [July 9](#saturday-july-9)) and believed to be those of the princes Edward V and Richard.

<img src="./2022-7-11/princes.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Bones discovered in the Tower of London and attributed as being those of Edward V and Richard*

Like many cathedrals, Westminster Abbey is constructed in the shape of a cross.  At the top of the cross is the Lady Chapel, which the audio guide described as being a sort of chapel within a chapel (a side chapel) dedicated to St. Mary.

<img src="./2022-7-11/lady_chapel_ceiling.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

*At the center lies an altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary*

The part of Westminster that I was most excited to see was Poet's Corner.  Poet's Corner is an area of the Abbey devoted to poets, writers, playwrights, and composers.  It consists of a large square cluster of graves as well as some others nearby, along with a ton of other memorials on the walls and even in the windows.

<img src="./2022-7-11/poets_corner_graves.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

And that ends your digital tour of Westminster Abbey!

<img src="./2022-7-11/westminster_abbey_2.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Leaving the Abbey*

Surrounding the nearby Parliament Square Garden are statues of a few different prominent figures, including Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, and Abraham Lincoln.  Maybe you can find a theme in there?

*Millicent Fawcett, a prominent leader in the women's suffrage movement of the UK.  The first statue of a woman and by a woman to be placed in Parliament Square*

After Westminster Abbey we ran over to the Natural History museum for another quick visit.  This time we went through an exhibit on the solar system and the formation of the Earth.  After our short visit there, we headed to our group dinner at Hereford Arms.

<img src="./2022-7-11/menu.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*What would you have ordered?*

I ended up getting the gnocchi for my main course, and the lemon bar for dessert (or pudding, as they say here).  The gnocchi was good, but the ratio of vegetables to gnocchi was a little high for me.  The desert was also good, but the combination of lemon and raspberry was very strong.

<img src="./2022-7-11/gnocchi.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

<img src="./2022-7-11/lemon_bar.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*"Glazed Lemon Tart, raspberry sorbet"*

After dinner, Brooklyn and I went back to the Criterion Theatre to see if there was any chance we could see Tom Felton, since I had missed seeing him on Friday.  As it turned out, they don't perform at that theatre on Mondays, so no luck there.  There *are*, however, performances at Duke of York's Theatre on Mondays, so we went there to see if we might get a chance to see Amy Adams once her show got out.

<img src="./2022-7-11/glass_menagerie_poster.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Brooklyn and I taking a photo with Amy Adams*

 We actually *did* get to see Amy Adams, but we weren't able to join the queue to meet her since we didn't have tickets to the show she was in.  I managed to get a picture of her anyways, and this way I didn't have to wear a mask.

<img src="./2022-7-11/amy_adams.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Me and Amy Adams*

Not a bad way to spend our last night in London.


### Sunday, July 10

After church this morning we went over to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  I'm not actually sure what it's a museum of specifically, because it felt like they had everything, but I suppose it would be considered an art museum at the very least.  The hall of statues seemed very familiar, and considering how close it is to the church, I'm willing to bet I've been in that same room before.

<img src="./2022-7-10/crouching_venus.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

*Not really sure how to work this photo in, but it's me in a medieval tunic*

One section of the museum was dedicated to copies of paintings and casts of statues.  Even though they weren't the originals, the replicas were still really impressive!

<img src="./2022-7-10/trajans_column.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

<img src="./2022-7-10/school_of_athens.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*The School of Athens*

Another fun section was the jewelry exhibit.  There was a huge range of pieces, including some peculiar ones.

<img src="./2022-7-10/chatelaine.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*This chatelaine is essentially a utility belt for homemaking.  Attached are a knife, lighter, scissors, and a key, among other items.*

<img src="./2022-7-10/jade_snail.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Jade snail*

The religion section was really interesting as well.  We were mostly just passing through to get to another exhibit, but a couple of things caught my eye.

<img src="./2022-7-10/communion_tray.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*"Many Noncomformist communities use individual communion cups."  Seem familiar?*

<img src="./2022-7-10/icthys_font.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*The surface of this piece was so smooth it was almost impossible to tell it was flat on top (besides the divet in the middle).  The plaque had its own explanation, but for me the fish are reminiscent of the miracle of the fish and loaves and when Christ called His disciples to be fishers of men.*

The exhibit that we were on our way to was the design exhibit.  It had a whole variety of different things, but I really liked the section they had on data privacy.

<img src="./2022-7-10/snowden_laptop.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*This laptop held top-secret files leaked to The Guardian by Edward Snowden.  It was destroyed in such a way that the files would be irrecoverable when handed over to the UK government.*

After visiting the V&A, we stopped at the Natural History for probably about an hour.  We went looking for a bear, but they were doing a lot of work on the mammal section, so we were unable to find one.

Afterwards we headed over to the Globe Theatre to see a production of King Lear.  We bought the standing tickets because they were super cheap, but I definitely had to sit on the ground a few times.  Standing for three hours is bad enough as it is, but it's even worse when you've been averaging seven miles of walking a day.

<img src="./2022-7-10/the_globe.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*View from standing in the Globe Theatre*

The portrayal was really well done, but the combination of being tired of standing, strong accents, and old fashioned English made it a bit hard to follow.  It also didn't help that a few of the characters were played by the same actors.  With pretty much every Shakespeare play involving someone in disguise, it was hard to tell who was in disguise and who was genuinely a different character.

### Saturday, July 9

This morning we went to the Tower of London.  What stood out to me the most was seeing the part of the wall in the White Tower where what are presumed to be the skeletons of the two missing (probably murdered) princes were found.  I remembered that story and could even visualize the location from the other time I visited the tower 19 years ago.

The White Tower had a ton of other cool stuff as well, including a huge armoury display, the Chapel of St. John, and a dragon!

<img src="./2022-7-9/giants_armour.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Trying to imitate the "giant's armour"*

<img src="./2022-7-9/dragon.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*I should have grabbed a sword from the armoury while I had the chance!*

In addition to the White Tower, we also got to see the crown jewels (another thing I remember from my previous visit), but pictures weren't allowed.  The other thing that really stuck out was learning about the different animals at the Tower.  The Tower is most known for its ravens, but it also was home to other exotic animals, including a polar bear that was gifted to Henry III by the King of Norway.  I have to wonder if that was an awkward exchange at all, as may occur when one buys their significant other a pet that they did not want or are unable to care for.

<img src="./2022-7-9/raven.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*One of the ravens and its ball.  I thought it was cute that it had a ball, especially since I don't typically think of ravens as being "playful"*

<img src="./2022-7-9/polar_bear.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Polar bear and a very small raven*

After the Tower of London a couple of us went to see [2:22: A Ghost Story](https://222aghoststory.com) at the Criterion Theatre.  We went at the recommendation of some others in our group who had seen it the previous night, and also managed to get a photo with Tom Felton, who plays one of the leads.

<img src="./2022-7-9/222_marquee.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Outside Criterion Theatre*

The show was fantastic, and I really liked how detailed the set was.  Sometimes sets can be a little bare-bones, especially when there are lots of transitions in a play, but this one seemed very complete, down to all the different things on the kitchen counter.

<img src="./2022-7-9/222_stage.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*I really liked the set*

I won't say too much about the play itself, other than that it was scary, which made it very fun.  I'll be keeping an eye out to see if it ends up coming to the States at some point.

<img src="./2022-7-9/tom_felton_poster.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Tom Felton!  (Draco Malfoy for those who don't recognize him)*

Unfortunately Tom Felton didn't come out for photos or signing after the performance we went to, but I did manage to get the signatures of two of the other actors, Beatriz Romilly and Sam Swainsbury.  They were both in a little bit of a rush but very nice nonetheless.  Beatriz told me to "enjoy the sunshine."

<img src="./2022-7-9/criterion_stage_door.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*The door where Tom Felton would have come out of*

After waiting around in vain for Tom, MacKayla and I went to Honest Burgers for dinner, where we split the [monthly](https://www.honestburgers.co.uk/food/burgers/morocco/) and [local](https://www.honestburgers.co.uk/food/burgers/brewer-st/) specials half and half.

<img src="./2022-7-9/honest_burgers.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>
*Half a Morocco and half a Brewer St. from Honest Burgers*

After dinner took a bus up to Abbey Road.  We walked across the Abbey Road crosswalk for the experience first, with plans to come back for photos, and then went into the Abbey Road Studios shop.  They definitely did have a lot of Beatles stuff, but I was surprised they didn't lean into it more.  There were a lot of items that were just Abbey Road Studios themed, as well as smaller selections of items for other artists they had recorded, such as Pink Floyd.

One of the items they had was based on the iconic ["John & Paul & Ringo & George" design](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/29936/john-and-paul-and-ringo-and-george-and-and-an), which happened to go along with the shirt I was wearing at the time.

<img src="./2022-7-9/&&&.jpeg" style="max-height: 90vh"><br>

After visiting the shop, we wrote our names on their wall (intended for that) outside and took the obligatory photos.

*The only Abbey Road sign that we could find that wasn't way too high to reach.  I'm guessing the took down the reachable ones near the crossing due to all the vandalism.*

On the way back to the underground, I spotted a sign for a street called Violet Hill, which is the name of a [song by Coldplay](https://songwhip.com/coldplay/violet-hill) and happens to be one of my favorites of theirs.  I looked it up, and sure enough, Wikipedia confirmed that the song "derives its title from a street of the same name near Abbey Road."

### Friday, July 8

Today we went to the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum.  They're right next to each other, as well as right by the church building that we meet at.  We only had time for the dinosaur exhibit before we had to head to the Science Museum, but it was really interesting.  Apparently MacKayla is an expert in dinosaurs, so she made an excellent tour guide.

At the Science Museum, we went to look at the double helix model as a group, and Dr. Johnson gave us a mini-lecture on how the structure of DNA was discovered.  More on that in my MMBIO writeup at the bottom for today.

*Replica of Watson and Crick's double helix model that we had a lecture next to.  There was another one that looked exactly like it in a gallery downstairs, and funny enough, I think that is the one that actually included the original metal plates from W&C's model.*

The whole medical exhibit was really cool, but really gross too.  There was a wax model of a partially dissected human body, and I have to say, it was probably more difficult to look at than the *actual* human bodies that I saw at the California Science Center one time.  That being said, I've included it below for the sake of science.

*Definitely the most lifelike anatomical model I've ever seen...*

One of the parts I enjoyed that wasn't gross was seeing some of the old fashioned medical equipment.  I was admiring a diagram for a wrist-mounted heart rate monitor when Dallin pointed out, "You're wearing one right now" in reference to my Apple Watch.

Another cool piece of equipment we saw was one of the first ECG machines.  I have one of those on my wrist too!

The Science Museum wasn't just medical science.  We also looked at the exhibits on the Information Age, mathematics, and space.

The mathematics exhibit was a lot more interesting than it might sound at first.  They had a small section on cryptography that I really liked, as well as a really interesting section on statistical visualizations, including the work of Florence Nightingale in making medical statistics more accessible.

These last two displays were right across from each other in the "Making the Modern World" gallery:

As I mentioned at the beginning, the church building is really close by the museums, so after grabbing a quick dinner we headed over to the church for an organ concert that was going on.  The Hyde Park building organ is already [very impressive on its own](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/6c/76/a0/pipe-organ-in-hyde-park.jpg), but we were lucky enough to hear Dr. Richard Elliot (Principal Organist for the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square) perform on it.  He was of course, very talented, and I particularly enjoyed a part where he played very quickly on only the foot pedals.  [Here's the program](./2022-7-8/concert_program.pdf) if anyone is interested in seeing what was performed or learning more about Dr. Elliot.

On the way back after the concert we heard some music of a *different* style, which ended up being a Pearl Jam concert in Hyde Park.  We decided to take a detour, and ended up getting pretty close to where they were playing.  I'll link a [video here](./2022-7-8/pearl_jam.mov).  If you listen closely, you'll also hear the sound of people listening to trap music.  Why anyone would do that when they could be listening to Pearl Jam performing live is beyond me.

> #### MMBIO Writeup:<br>Double Helix at the Science Museum
>
> **Historical Significance**
> - The discovery of the double helix was a huge advancement in our understanding of DNA.  DNA was discovered in 1869, but it wasn't until 1953 that Watson and Crick published their findings on the double helix structure.

> **Scientific Principles**
> - *beware of pride*—Another scientist named Linus Pauling ended up snubbing the work of a Erwin Chargaff because he found him annoying.  As it turned out, Chargaff's Rule (see "Coolest Part") was a key piece of information that could have led Pauling to discover the double helix structure first, had his arrogance not caused him to overlook Chargaff.
