## Museum Curation

##### [Curator_The_Museum_Journal\_-\_September\_1968\_-\_Oppenheimer\_-\_A\_Rationale\_for\_a\_Science\_Museum.pdf](./Curator_The_Museum_Journal_-_September_1968_-_Oppenheimer_-_A_Rationale_for_a_Science_Museum.pdf)

#### What was the main point of the paper?
The paper was written to propose a science museum (not sure if it is for a specific location or just for science museums in general) and provide arguments for what value a science museum would have and how the creation of one could be achieved.

#### Do we have good science museums now?
We have some great science museums, but I'm sure we could use more in lots of places!  Even in places where we do have science museums, we could work on encouraging more people to attend and making them more accessible to those who are currently unable to attend them.  One of my favorite science museums is the [California Science Center](https://californiasciencecenter.org) in Los Angeles, California.

#### Which was your favorite museum we went to?
We haven't been to any museums yet, but I'm particularly excited to visit the Louvre!  I'm really interested in the wide variety of art that is housed by the Louvre and have heard a lot of great things about it.


## The Plague, bring out your dead!

##### [Plague.pdf](./Plague.pdf)

#### What was the main idea from this paper?
The main purpose of this paper was to provide a medical/historical review of the plague.  In particular, the main idea was that the plague can be carried and transmitted in a variety of ways, which has made it difficult to eradicate.

#### How does it apply to us now?
We are currently working to reduce the transmission rates of coronavirus.  Like coronavirus, one form of plague is transmitted through respiratory droplets.  Additionally, both plague and coronavirus have led to certain ethnic groups being discriminated against due to unfounded blame.

## The Broad Street Pump...How do you know he is a king?

##### https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/removal.html#:~:text=John%20Snow%20is%20credited%20with,action%20on%20September%207%2C%201854

#### What was the main idea/discovery/significance of what John Snow did?
John Snow discovered what he believed to be the source of the cholera outbreak, and intervened in order to stop the spread of cholera.  Most significantly, John Snow discovered that cholera spreads via contaminated water.

#### Had it been done before?
I am not aware of any earlier historical efforts to stop outbreaks similar to what John Snow did, but I imagine there may have been some.  John Snow seems to be the first person to recognize that cholera spreads through contaminated water.

## Fleming and Penicillin...the man who's got everything.

##### [Fleming.pdf](./Fleming.pdf)

#### What was the main finding from the paper?
Penicillin has properties that inhibit the growth of and kills certain bacteria but allows the growth of other kinds.

#### How did this change medicine?
Penicillin was one of the earliest modern antibiotics to be discovered.  It allowed doctors to treat bacterial infections that were previously untreatable.

#### Was Fleming looking to discover antibiotics?
Fleming was not researching antibiotics, but he was researching staphylococcus variants.  He made an observation when penicillium unexpectedly started growing in some of his cultures and inhibited the growth of the staphylococcus that he was studying.  From there he investigated and discovered penicillin.

Q: What do you give a man who's got everything?<br>
A: Penicillin.


## The Structure of DNA...what are the data?

##### [watson-crick.pdf](./watson-crick.pdf)

#### Why was this paper important?
The understanding the structure of DNA that this paper established became foundational knowledge for many areas of biology.  This includes providing a better understanding of the processes by which DNA is replicated in asexual reproduction and how it is combined in sexual reproduction.

#### What was the main insight that helped them figure out the structure of DNA?
The ratios of purines to pyrimidines helped them recognize the base pairing that occurs in DNA, which helped lead them to the double helix (rather than a triple helix) structure.


## Fermentation...I promise I didn't have a drink.

##### [Fermentation.pdf](./Fermentation.pdf)

#### Why is fermentation important?
Fermentation is important because it plays a vital role in the creation of alcohol, coffee, and chocolate.  It additionally has applications in processing of waste water.  Fermentation is important to yeast because it helps keep yeast alive!

#### Can fermentation be done without Saccharomyces?  Without yeast?
Yes!  Fermentation is a process that is common to all bacteria and eukaryotes.  This means that non-saccharomycetes can perform fermentation, as can all other eukaryotes as well as bacterias (regardless of whether yeast is present or not).

## Jenner, no, we're not talking Caitlyn, but maybe Kylie.

##### [Jenner.pdf](./Jenner.pdf)

#### What was Jenner's discovery?
Jenner discovered that inoculation with Cow Pox created immunity to smallpox.

#### Was it the first example of this?
Jenner was not the first to develop the idea of inoculation with the goal of creating immunity.  During his time, people were inoculated with small amounts of smallpox with the goal of creating immunity, but the process was sometimes ineffective, failing to cause a reaction and subsequent immunity, or overly effective, causing people to become sick and die.  Others may have observed the immunity effect of Cow Pox, but Jenner was the first to systematically study it and experiment with it.  This is the first example of inoculation for one virus using a weaker variant of it.

#### What does it teach us about the scientific method?
The scientific method works!  And often it starts with observations of the things around us, whether that be observations of daily life (as in Jenner's case), or observations within a laboratory environment (as in Flemming's).  Using the rest of the scientific method, one may hypothesize the cause for these observations and experiment in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis.

## Louis Pasteur, did he spontaneously come up with this stuff?

##### [Pasteur.pdf](./Pasteur.pdf)

#### What was most significant about this work by Pasteur?
Pasteur discovered that if he boiled liquids and sealed them from the exposure to the air that microorganisms would not grow, thus disproving the theory of spontaneous generation of microorganisms.  The process he used to prove this is enormously significant, because it is now used to avoid contamination throughout other research, food processing, and more.  This process is known today as pasteurization.

#### How did it change medicine and microbiology?
Pasteur's research changed our understanding of microorganisms by showing that they are present in the air and do not spontaneously generate.  Pasteurization made it possible to better isolate and culture microbiological samples for research.  In addition, it helped develop our understanding of how to sanitize medical equipment for procedures.

## Koch, it's the real thing

##### [Koch.pdf](./Koch.pdf)

#### What was Koch's greatest contribution to science?
He developed "Koch's postulates," which became a methodology for proving beyond doubt whether the cause of a disease is a particular bacteria.

#### What are his postulates?  Did he always use them?
His postulates stated that if one isolates and cultures a bacteria from a diseased organism, the bacteria is then separate from any other possible causes of that disease.  If, when a healthy organism is innoculated with that bacteria, the organism develops the same disease as the first, it can be concluded that the bacteria is the cause of that disease.  Koch did not always or formally use these postulates, but he developed them as he went.  It was later on, in writing "The etiology of tuberculosis," that he formalized these postulates in a way that they could be repeated by others in future research.

#### How did Koch change medicine?
By formalizing his postulates into a repeatable structure, Koch made it possible for other scientists to determine the cause of other diseases by following the same methodology.  Additionally, Koch showed the cause of tuberculosis, helping people to understand how to treat and prevent it in the future.

Luckily he was alright because it was a soft drink.


## Ignaz Semmelweis, not to be confused with Edelweiss

##### [Semmelweis.pdf](./Semmelweis.pdf)

#### What was Semmelweis's discovery?
Semmelweis discovered, in part, the importance of hygiene in his discovery of the risks of transmitting "cadaverous matter" to healthy patients.  He additionally developed an early version of a randomized control trial.

#### How did it shape the way science is done?
Semmelweis's study influenced the way people went about doing research by helping them recognize that diseases have an identifiable cause and that the cause can be discovered through RCTs.

#### How did it change medicine?
This changed how developments in medicine came about, because it gave people a scientific way of evaluating the effectiveness of treatments.  Using randomized control groups for comparison, it became possible to see if a treatment really helped from a statistical point of view.
