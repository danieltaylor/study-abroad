## London

#### Thursday, July 7

Today we went on a walking tour around London led by Dr. Breakwell.  We stopped by lots of different sites, including the first public drinking fountain, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and St. John's Ambulance.

From what I understand, St. John's Ambulence is kind of like the Red Cross.  It has a youth organization called the Badgers, and if you collect all nine Badger badges, you can become a Super Badger!

*The coveted (by me) Bertie Badger figurine awarded to Super Badgers*

We also stopped by the Charterhouse, which had a cool greyhound motif to it.  The ends of the staircase banisters had carved greyhounds topping them, but we hadn't realized we weren't supposed to be over there without a tour guide, so we got kicked out before I could get a picture with them.  I did manage to get a picture with John Wesley, however.

After the Charterhouse we broke off into smaller groups, one of which I nobly led to King's Cross Station.

We of course were there to see Platform 9¾.  I didn't get any pictures once I made it to the platform itself, but I have one of me about to enter.

*Entering Platform 9¾*

We regrouped at an Indian restaurant, Dishoom, for lunch.  We ate family style, but there was a set menu so we didn't have to argue over what to get at all.

*What we ate*

In the evening we went to see Agatha Christie's *The Mousetrap* at St. Martin's Theatre by Leicester Square.  I had a 4-pack of butterbeer in my bag from earlier so I had to leave it at the front counter.  The lady checking bags was really nice, but I was embarrassed thinking about how probably thought it was actual beer.  The play itself was really good, and the part where Miss Casewell says the newspaper contains the "usual political crisis" was [particularly relevant today](https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-to-resign-as-prime-minister-12646836) and got an extra good laugh.

#### Wednesday, July 6

Today we spent most of the day at Kew Royal Botanical Gardens.  We started off with a tour of the fungarium, where they store over 1.25 million specimens of fungi!

<img src="./2022-7-6/fungarium.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Inside each box is loads of packets of dried fungi specimens*

A lot of the specimens have historical value as well as scientific, including some samples that constitute the first ecological study ever, and some morels that were collected by Charles Darwin himself.

<img src="./2022-7-6/morels.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Morels collected by Charles Darwin*

Afterwards we had a lab tour and then listened to a lecture on mycology.  From there we were free to walk around the gardens.  We grabbed lunch first, for which I got a squash, mozzarella, and pesto pizza.  The mozzarella was really creamy, and like no mozzarella I'd ever had before.  I was wondering what made it so different, and whether it was some sort of fancy British mozzarella.  It wasn't until after I'd finished eating it that we were able to determine that it was vegan mozzarella.  On its own it was good, but from that perspective, I decided that the mozzarella was terrible, because it tasted nothing like actual mozzarella.  This was not unlike how beautiful the acoustics in St. Paul's Cathedral were yesterday from an auditory perspective, but how absolutely atrocious they were as far as comprehension of the singing went (and no, they were not singing in Latin the other time as some thought they had been).

Kew had lots of different greenhouses, and it was super interesting to feel the different climates (tropical, arid, temperate) as we walked through different sections.

<img src="./2022-7-6/palm_house.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*The Palm House of Kew Gardens*

There were lots of interesting plants and I took tons of photos, but here are a few of the ones that turned out reasonably well:

<img src="./2022-7-6/purple_flowers.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>

<img src="./2022-7-6/pink_flowers.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>

Another fun part of the gardens was their Treetop Walkway, where, obviously enough, we were able to walk around the treetops.  I was however a little disappointed at the lack of treehouses.

<img src="./2022-7-6/treetops.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Becoming one with the trees*

One other cool thing we saw at Kew Gardens was a structure called "The Hive."  Sometimes they light up different parts of it, which I'm sure would have made it even more impressive.

<img src="./2022-7-6/hive_exterior.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>

I especially liked the view of the top from the inside.

<img src="./2022-7-6/hive_interior.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Inside The Hive*

We also found this cool blue box right outside the station on our way back.  It was locked, so I can't confirm whether or not it's bigger on the inside.

#### Tuesday, July 5

We started off the day by going to the Museum of London where we had a lecture on osteoarcheology.  Essentially it was about how we can look at bones that have been dug up and learn about civilizations, and the diseases people were affected by in particular.  We got to see and handle a TON of really old (~700 years) bones, which was super interesting!  We were asked not to post them online, but I figure I can just post this one and it will be okay.

<img src="./2022-7-5/chapless_skull.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>

For lunch we went to Borough Market, where I got a pulled pork sandwich.  The sandwich was probably about half as good as it would have been if it had had barbecue sauce on it, but it still ended up being just about as messy.

<img src="./2022-7-5/pulled_pork.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>

It also turns out Borough Market is [the site of the Leaky Cauldron](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/0a/bd/cc0abd3e4a3ed4533504ebee8bc425bd.jpg) in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*.  The taco place is what would have been the Leaky Cauldron, and the place on the right (the one that says "Arthur") was the Third Hand Book Emporium.

<img src="./2022-7-5/leaky_tacos.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Something tells me Tom doesn't work there anymore.*

After stopping by the Leaky Cauldron, we went to the *other* Leaky Cauldron—the one from *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (or *Sorcerer's Stone* for you Yanks)—in Leadenhall Market, which is also where Diagon Alley was filmed.

*Me and ~~Hagrid~~ Malcon outside the Leaky Cauldron*

Later on, we visited All Hallows by the Tower, which is the oldest church in London, founded in 675 AD.  It also happens to be where both William Penn and John Quincy Adams were baptized.  It's too bad we didn't go yesterday so we could get that bit of American history in for the Fourth of July.  The crypt museum, which was under the church, was the most interesting part for me.  After that we went to St. Paul's Cathedral for Evensong.  Admission was free since we were going to listen to the choir, but it was with the restriction that we couldn't take pictures while we were inside.

<img src="./2022-7-5/st_pauls.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Outside St. Paul's Cathedral*

We finished off the day by stopping to see Big Ben, which is we technically didn't see, because Big Ben is actually the name of the bell inside the Elizabeth Tower.

#### Monday, July 4

Happy Fourth of July!  We didn't do much to celebrate today, but I *did* find a peacock feather that I stuck in my hat and promptly called macaroni.

<img src="./2022-7-4/peacock.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*The peacock that so graciously left a feather behind for me*

Our first stop for the today was the Grant Museum of Zoology, which is a massive collection of about 65,000 specimens (8,000 of those are sets of mouse bones that were collected for a study, with 4,000 of them on display.

<img src="./2022-7-4/mouse_bones.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*4,000 sets of mouse bones*

The Grant Museum had an incredible variety of specimens.

*Any guesses who this heart once belonged to?*

<img src="./2022-7-4/microscope_slides.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Lots and lots of microscope slides*

For lunch we all stopped at a place called Pret, which apparently does have some locations in the US, although it's UK-based.  I got a tomato and Brie sandwich, which was delicious, and a rhubarb lemonade, which I assume is about as close to a hard lemonade as you can get without actually having any alcohol in it—it was really strong.

<img src="./2022-7-4/rhubarb_lemonade.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Prêt à Manger (the full name of Pret) is French for "ready to eat"*

After lunch we did a bit of walking to get to the next site, with some cool things along the way.  One street we went down seemed to be all guitar shops.  I can think of at least one family member who would've been in heaven there.

<img src="./2022-7-4/taylor_guitars.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>

We also saw some cool street art along our walk.

<img src="./2022-7-4/spaceship.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*"Spaceship!!!"*

Our final destination was the Broad Street Pump, which is where John Snow (no relation to Jon Snow) famously removed the handle of the pump as part of his investigation of the [1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak).

*Broad Street pump with the cholera that Dr. Breakwell gave me*

After the pump we broke off into smaller groups.  After going to Carnaby Street and realizing everything felt to expensive for us to even go inside most of the shops, we headed over to the British Museum.

For dinner we went to a pub called Pride of Paddington.  The food was good, but my favorite part was seeing all the Paddington Bear sites nearby.

I think it's safe to say the true pride of Paddington lies in its bear rather than in its pub.

#### Sunday, July 3

Today we attended sacrament meeting at the Hyde Park Ward.  The building they meet in is super interesting; it functions as a meetinghouse, a visitors' center, a mission office, etc., etc.

<img src="./2022-7-3/church_group.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*This was just part of our group—the rest went to later wards*

After church we took the tube down to Wimbledon for The Championships.  I'm not a huge tennis fan myself, but everyone else was going and I figured at the very least it would be worth going for bragging rights.

<img src="./2022-7-3/tennis_throne.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*I thought it was odd that a tournament in the UK was sponsored by AmEx*

We bought the cheap tickets, so we didn't get to see anything at the central court, but we were able to catch some really good doubles matches.  In the first one, a Women's Doubles match, the team from the US managed to catch up on a 5-1 set with 5 wins in a row.  Unfortunately the other team tied it back up to 6-6 and them went on to win the tie breaker.

<img src="./2022-7-3/womens_doubles.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Alison Riske-Amritraj serving in the Women's Doubles match*

Between that match and a Men's Doubles I grabbed some food, which I have been requested to include pictures of.

<img src="./2022-7-3/high_hurst.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*High Hurst sausage on a sourdough bun with fried onions and sriracha mayo*

In the Men's Doubles match, we got to see the number one ranked team play, which had one player from the US and another from Great Britain.  It was a thrilling match, and the reactions of one of the opposing players were very entertaining.

<img src="./2022-7-3/rajeev_ram.jpeg" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Rajeev Ram (USA) serving in the Men's Doubles match*

Overall the tennis games were really fun to watch, and certainly beat all the walking around that we've been doing to get places.  I think it's safe to say the trip was worth more than bragging rights to me, but that also didn't stop me from buying a hat to show off.

#### Saturday, July 2

This morning (or at least what feels like this morning), I took the train up to the SLC airport where I met up with another girl in my group.  From SLC we had a layover in LAX, and then a long flight to the London Heathrow Airport.  All of our attendants on the second flight had interesting accents.  Once we made it to the airport, we met up with another girl in our group and took the underground to Earl's Court Station.  It was a long, fairly boring, and crowded ride with about 15 stops along the way.  From there, we walked about a mile to get to our hostel, arriving around 3:30 pm.  We were surprised at how many stairs there were coming out of the metro station, which probably wouldn't have been something we would have noticed had we not had our suitcases with us.  After making it to the hostel, we met up with some more of our group—including Dr. Breakwell and his wife—and went out to get food and take a brief walk by Kensington Palace.

<img src="./2022-7-2/kensington.png" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Kensington Palace*

At Kensington, Dr. Breakwell and his wife got something called a 99, which is an ice cream cone with a Flake bar that unfortunately costs much more than 99 pence.  I'll plan on getting one soon, so stay tuned.  Other than the many, many dogs that we saw, one of my favorite parts was seeing the statue of Queen Victoria.  It would have been slightly better if I'd been able to witness *la rana* that I heard a Hispanic boy pointing out to his parents, but it was still a great statue, and the lily pads in front of it were very pretty.

<img src="./2022-7-2/victoria.png" style="max-height: 650px; max-width: 650px"><br>
*Queen Victoria statue at Kensington Palace*

Back at the hostel, I beat a couple other guys in my group at blackjack.  Lucky for them, we were just playing with chips and not real money, because (1) I don't gamble, and (2) foreign currency does not come cheap.  Hopefully I'll manage to keep up on writing about my travels here and keep it interesting as well.  If anyone has any suggestions for things to do while I'm here, please let me know!
