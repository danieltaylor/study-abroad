## London

#### Wednesday, July 6

Today we spent most of the day at Kew Royal Botanical Gardens.  We started off with a tour of the fungarium, where they store over 1.25 million specimens of fungi!

*Inside each box is loads of packets of dried fungi specimens*

A lot of the specimens have historical value as well as scientific, including some samples that constitute the first ecological study ever, and some morels that were collected by Charles Darwin himself.

Afterwards we had a lab tour and then listened to a lecture on mycology.  From there we were free to walk around the gardens.  We grabbed lunch first, for which I got a squash, mozzarella, and pesto pizza.  The mozzarella was really creamy, and like no mozzarella I'd ever had before.  I was wondering what made it so different, and whether it was some sort of fancy British mozzarella.  It wasn't until after I'd finished eating it that we were able to determine that it was vegan mozzarella.  On its own it was good, but from that perspective, I decided that the mozzarella was terrible, because it tasted nothing like actual mozzarella.  This was not unlike how beautiful the acoustics in St. Paul's Cathedral were yesterday from an auditory perspective, but how absolutely atrocious they were as far as comprehension of the singing went (and no, they were not singing in Latin the other time as some thought they had been).

Kew had lots of different greenhouses, and it was super interesting to feel the different climates (tropical, arid, temperate) as we walked through different sections.

There were lots of interesting plants and I took tons of photos, but here are a few of the ones that turned out reasonably well:

Another fun part of the gardens was their Treetop Walkway, where, obviously enough, we were able to walk around the treetops.  I was however a little disappointed at the lack of treehouses.

One other cool thing we saw at Kew Gardens was a structure called "The Hive."  Sometimes they light up different parts of it, which I'm sure would have made it even more impressive.

I especially liked the view of the top from the inside.

We also found this cool blue box right outside the station on our way back.  It was locked, so I can't confirm whether or not it's bigger on the inside.

#### Tuesday, July 5

We started off the day by going to the Museum of London where we had a lecture on osteoarcheology.  Essentially it was about how we can look at bones that have been dug up and learn about civilizations, and the diseases people were affected by in particular.  We got to see and handle a TON of really old (~700 years) bones, which was super interesting!  We were asked not to post them online, but I figure I can just post this one and it will be okay.

For lunch we went to Borough Market, where I got a pulled pork sandwich.  The sandwich was probably about half as good as it would have been if it had had barbecue sauce on it, but it still ended up being just about as messy.

It also turns out Borough Market is [the site of the Leaky Cauldron](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/0a/bd/cc0abd3e4a3ed4533504ebee8bc425bd.jpg) in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*.  The taco place is what would have been the Leaky Cauldron, and the place on the right (the one that says "Arthur") was the Third Hand Book Emporium.

*Something tells me Tom doesn't work there anymore.*

After stopping by the Leaky Cauldron, we went to the *other* Leaky Cauldron—the one from *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (or *Sorcerer's Stone* for you Yanks)—in Leadenhall Market, which is also where Diagon Alley was filmed.

Later on, we visited All Hallows by the Tower, which is the oldest church in London, founded in 675 AD.  It also happens to be where both William Penn and John Quincy Adams were baptized.  It's too bad we didn't go yesterday so we could get that bit of American history in for the Fourth of July.  The crypt museum, which was under the church, was the most interesting part for me.  After that we went to St. Paul's Cathedral for Evensong.  Admission was free since we were going to listen to the choir, but it was with the restriction that we couldn't take pictures while we were inside.

We finished off the day by stopping to see Big Ben, which is we technically didn't see, because Big Ben is actually the name of the bell inside the Elizabeth Tower.

[in progress]


#### Sunday, July 3

Today we attended sacrament meeting at the Hyde Park Ward.  The building they meet in is super interesting; it functions as a meetinghouse, a visitors' center, a mission office, etc., etc.

*This was just part of our group—the rest went to later wards*

After church we took the tube down to Wimbledon for The Championships.  I'm not a huge tennis fan myself, but everyone else was going and I figured at the very least it would be worth going for bragging rights.

*I thought it was odd that a tournament in the UK was sponsored by AmEx*

We bought the cheap tickets, so we didn't get to see anything at the central court, but we were able to catch some really good doubles matches.  In the first one, a Women's Doubles match, the team from the US managed to catch up on a 5-1 set with 5 wins in a row.  Unfortunately the other team tied it back up to 6-6 and them went on to win the tie breaker.

Between that match and a Men's Doubles I grabbed some food, which I have been requested to include pictures of.

In the Men's Doubles match, we got to see the number one ranked team play, which had one player from the US and another from Great Britain.  It was a thrilling match, and the reactions of one of the opposing players were very entertaining.

Overall the tennis games were really fun to watch, and certainly beat all the walking around that we've been doing to get places.  I think it's safe to say the trip was worth more than bragging rights to me, but that also didn't stop me from buying a hat to show off.

#### Saturday, July 2

This morning (or at least what feels like this morning), I took the train up to the SLC airport where I met up with another girl in my group.  From SLC we had a layover in LAX, and then a long flight to the London Heathrow Airport.  All of our attendants on the second flight had interesting accents.  Once we made it to the airport, we met up with another girl in our group and took the underground to Earl's Court Station.  It was a long, fairly boring, and crowded ride with about 15 stops along the way.  From there, we walked about a mile to get to our hostel, arriving around 3:30 pm.  We were surprised at how many stairs there were coming out of the metro station, which probably wouldn't have been something we would have noticed had we not had our suitcases with us.  After making it to the hostel, we met up with some more of our group—including Dr. Breakwell and his wife—and went out to get food and take a brief walk by Kensington Palace.

At Kensington, Dr. Breakwell and his wife got something called a 99, which is an ice cream cone with a Flake bar that unfortunately costs much more than 99 pence.  I'll plan on getting one soon, so stay tuned.  Other than the many, many dogs that we saw, one of my favorite parts was seeing the statue of Queen Victoria.  It would have been slightly better if I'd been able to witness *la rana* that I heard a Hispanic boy pointing out to his parents, but it was still a great statue, and the lily pads in front of it were very pretty.

Back at the hostel, I beat a couple other guys in my group at blackjack.  Lucky for them, we were just playing with chips and not real money, because (1) I don't gamble, and (2) foreign currency does not come cheap.  Hopefully I'll manage to keep up on writing about my travels here and keep it interesting as well.  If anyone has any suggestions for things to do while I'm here, please let me know!
