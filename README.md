## London

#### Sunday, July 3

Today we attended sacrament meeting at the Hyde Park Ward.  The building they meet in is super interesting; it functions as a meetinghouse, a visitors' center, a mission office, etc., etc.

*This was just part of our group—the rest went to later wards*

After church we took the tube down to Wimbledon for The Championships.  I'm not a huge tennis fan myself, but everyone else was going and I figured at the very least it would be worth going for bragging rights.

We bought the cheap tickets, so we didn't get to see anything at the central court, but we were able to catch some really good doubles matches.  In the first one, a Women's Doubles match, the team from the US managed to catch up on a 5-1 set with 5 wins in a row.  Unfortunately the other team tied it back up to 6-6 and them went on to win the tie breaker.

Between that match and a Men's Doubles I grabbed some food, which I have been requested to include pictures of.

In the Men's Doubles match, we got to see the number one ranked team play, which had one player from the US and another from Great Britain.  It was a thrilling match, and the reactions of one of the opposing players were very entertaining.

Overall the tennis games were really fun to watch, and certainly beat all the walking around that we've been doing to get places.  I think it's safe to say the trip was worth more than bragging rights to me, but that also didn't stop me from buying a hat to show off.

#### Saturday, July 2

This morning (or at least what feels like this morning), I took the train up to the SLC airport where I met up with another girl in my group.  From SLC we had a layover in LAX, and then a long flight to the London Heathrow Airport.  All of our attendants on the second flight had interesting accents.  Once we made it to the airport, we met up with another girl in our group and took the underground to Earl's Court Station.  It was a long, fairly boring, and crowded ride with about 15 stops along the way.  From there, we walked about a mile to get to our hostel, arriving around 3:30 pm.  We were surprised at how many stairs there were coming out of the metro station, which probably wouldn't have been something we would have noticed had we not had our suitcases with us.  After making it to the hostel, we met up with some more of our group—including Dr. Breakwell and his wife—and went out to get food and take a brief walk by Kensington Palace.

At Kensington, Dr. Breakwell and his wife got something called a 99, which is an ice cream cone with a Flake bar that unfortunately costs much more than 99 pence.  I'll plan on getting one soon, so stay tuned.  Other than the many, many dogs that we saw, one of my favorite parts was seeing the statue of Queen Victoria.  It would have been slightly better if I'd been able to witness *la rana* that I heard a Hispanic boy pointing out to his parents, but it was still a great statue, and the lily pads in front of it were very pretty.

Back at the hostel, I beat a couple other guys in my group at blackjack.  Lucky for them, we were just playing with chips and not real money, because (1) I don't gamble, and (2) foreign currency does not come cheap.  Hopefully I'll manage to keep up on writing about my travels here and keep it interesting as well.  If anyone has any suggestions for things to do while I'm here, please let me know!
